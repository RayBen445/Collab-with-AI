# Authentication System Tests

This directory contains tests for validating the authentication system of the Collab-with-AI platform.

## Test Files

### `auth-test.html`
Comprehensive authentication system tests that validate:

- ✅ Environment configuration loading
- ✅ Authentication service availability  
- ✅ Admin email configuration
- ✅ Authentication guards on protected pages
- ✅ API security features
- ✅ Module loading and accessibility

## Running Tests

### Local Testing
1. Start a local web server from the project root:
   ```bash
   python3 -m http.server 8000
   ```

2. Open the test page in your browser:
   ```
   http://localhost:8000/tests/auth-test.html
   ```

3. Tests will automatically run and display results

### Expected Results
When all authentication fixes are properly implemented, you should see:

- ✅ Environment configuration loaded successfully
- ✅ Firebase auth module files accessible
- ✅ Admin email format validation passed
- ✅ Protected pages have authentication code
- ✅ API security features implemented
- ✅ Module files accessible

## Integration with Health Check

The authentication tests are designed to complement the existing `health-check.html` system and provide deeper validation of authentication components.

## Security Validations

The tests specifically check for:

1. **Environment Security**: Proper config loading with fallbacks
2. **Token Validation**: Secure token comparison methods
3. **Rate Limiting**: API protection against abuse
4. **Authentication Guards**: Page protection mechanisms
5. **Admin Role Handling**: Secure admin privilege management

## Troubleshooting

If tests fail:

1. **Environment Config Failures**: Check that `js/env-config.js` is properly loaded
2. **Module Loading Failures**: Verify file paths and server configuration
3. **API Security Failures**: Ensure `api/get-gemini-key.js` has security enhancements
4. **Auth Guard Failures**: Check that protected pages include Firebase authentication

## Next Steps

Future enhancements could include:
- Automated testing with CI/CD integration
- Firebase emulator testing
- End-to-end authentication flow testing
- Performance testing for auth operations
