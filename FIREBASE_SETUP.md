## 📁 File Structure

### Core Firebase Files
- `firebase.json` - Firebase project configuration
- `firestore.rules` - Database security rules
- `firestore.indexes.json` - Database indexes
- `storage.rules` - File storage security rules
- `.env.local` - Environment variables (local development)

### JavaScript Services
- `js/firebase-config.js` - Firebase initialization and configuration
- `js/firebase-auth.js` - Authentication service with all auth operations
- `js/firebase-database.js` - Database service with CRUD operations
- `js/firebase-storage.js` - Storage service with file operations
- `js/gemini-api.js` - Updated to use Cloud Functions

### Cloud Functions
- `functions/index.js` - All serverless functions
- `functions/package.json` - Dependencies for Cloud Functions
- `functions/.eslintrc.json` - ESLint configuration

## 🔒 Security Implementation

### Database Security Rules
```javascript
// Users can only access their own data
match /users/{userId} {
  allow read, write: if request.auth.uid == userId;
}

// Project access based on ownership/collaboration
match /projects/{projectId} {
  allow read: if request.auth != null;
  allow write: if resource.data.owner == request.auth.uid;
}

// Admin-only access for sensitive data
match /admin/{document=**} {
  allow read, write: if request.auth.token.email == 'oladoyeheritage445@gmail.com';
}
```

### Storage Security Rules
```javascript
// Users can upload to their own folders
match /users/{userId}/{allPaths=**} {
  allow read, write: if request.auth.uid == userId;
}

// Project members can access project files
match /projects/{projectId}/{allPaths=**} {
  allow read: if request.auth != null;
  allow write: if userHasProjectAccess(projectId);
}
```

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### 1. Firebase Project Setup
1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Create a new project named "collab-with-ai"
3. Enable Authentication, Firestore, Storage, and Functions
4. Configure authentication providers (Email/Password and Google)

### 2. Configuration Update
Update `js/firebase-config.js` with your project's configuration:
```javascript
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "your-actual-api-key",
  authDomain: "your-project.firebaseapp.com",
  projectId: "your-project-id",
  storageBucket: "your-project.appspot.com",
  messagingSenderId: "your-sender-id",
  appId: "your-app-id",
  measurementId: "your-measurement-id"
};
```

### 3. Environment Variables
Set these environment variables in Firebase Functions:
```bash
firebase functions:config:set gemini.api_key="your-gemini-api-key"
firebase functions:config:set admin.email="oladoyeheritage445@gmail.com"
```

### 4. Deploy to Firebase
```bash
# Install Firebase CLI
npm install -g firebase-tools

# Login to Firebase
firebase login

# Initialize project
firebase init

# Deploy everything
firebase deploy

# Deploy only functions
firebase deploy --only functions

# Deploy only hosting
firebase deploy --only hosting
```

if (password !== 'professor') {
  showError('Invalid password');
}
```

### After (Firebase Authentication)
```javascript
// Secure Firebase authentication
const result = await authService.signInWithEmail(email, password);
if (result.success) {
  // User authenticated with proper session management
}
```

- Real-time platform analytics
- User management capabilities  
- Project oversight tools
- API usage monitoring
- System health metrics

- Secure API key management

## 🚨 Important Notes

1. **API Keys**: Never commit API keys to version control
2. **Security Rules**: Test thoroughly before deploying to production
3. **Indexes**: Monitor Firestore usage and optimize indexes as needed
4. **Functions**: Monitor function execution and optimize for cost
5. **Storage**: Implement file size limits and content moderation

## 🛠️ Development Workflow

### Local Development
```bash
# Start Firebase emulators
firebase emulators:start

# This starts:
# - Authentication emulator on port 9099
# - Firestore emulator on port 8080  
# - Functions emulator on port 5001
# - Storage emulator on port 9199
```

### Testing
- All services work with local emulators
- No real Firebase resources consumed during development
- Easy reset of test data

### Deployment
```bash
# Deploy to staging
firebase use staging
firebase deploy

# Deploy to production  
firebase use production
firebase deploy
```

## 📞 Support
