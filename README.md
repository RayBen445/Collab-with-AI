- Data analysis and machine learning projects
- CLI tools and productivity applications
- Web scrapers and API integrations

### 🎮 Interactive Projects
- Browser-based games (puzzles, arcade-style, strategy)
- Educational simulations and demos
- Creative coding and generative art
- Interactive storytelling applications

### 📚 Learning & Documentation
- Programming tutorials with live examples
- Code snippet collections and templates
- Best practices guides
- Technical documentation with interactive elements

### 🛠️ Developer Tools
- Code generators and templates
- Development environment setups
- Testing utilities and frameworks
- Deployment automation scripts

## Getting Started

1. **Choose a project type** from the ideas above or suggest your own
2. **Define the scope** - let's start small and iterate
3. **Pick technologies** - we can work with various languages and frameworks
4. **Collaborate** - you provide requirements and feedback, I'll help with implementation

## 🔒 Security Guidelines

**Important: Never commit secrets or credentials to this repository!**

### Environment Variables (Required for Deployment)

When deploying to Vercel, you must set the following environment variables in your Vercel dashboard:

#### Required API Keys:
- `GEMINI_API_KEY` - Your Google Gemini API key
- `FIREBASE_API_KEY` - Firebase project API key
- `FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN` - Firebase auth domain
- `FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID` - Firebase project ID
- `FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET` - Firebase storage bucket
- `FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID` - Firebase messaging sender ID
- `FIREBASE_APP_ID` - Firebase app ID
- `FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID` - Firebase measurement ID

#### Required Admin Configuration:
- `ADMIN_TOKEN` - Secure admin authentication token
- `ADMIN_EMAIL` - Admin email address for elevated privileges

### How to Set Environment Variables in Vercel:

1. Go to your Vercel dashboard
2. Navigate to your project
3. Go to **Settings** → **Environment Variables**
4. Add each variable with its corresponding value
5. Select appropriate environments (Production, Preview, Development)

### Local Development:

Create a `.env.local` file in your project root (this file is automatically ignored by git):

```bash
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_firebase_api_key_here
# ... add other variables as needed
```

**⚠️ Never commit `.env` files or hardcode secrets in your source code!**

## How to Collaborate

1. **Start a conversation** - describe what you'd like to build
2. **Iterate together** - I'll implement while you provide feedback
3. **Test and refine** - we'll make sure everything works perfectly
4. **Document our work** - so others can learn from our collaboration
