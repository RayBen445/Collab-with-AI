# Collab-with-AI ü§ñü§ùüë®‚Äçüíª

Welcome to our collaborative workspace! This repository is designed for AI-human collaboration, where we can build amazing projects together.

## What Can We Create Together?

The possibilities are endless! Here are some exciting collaboration ideas:

### üåê [Web Applications](./projects/web-apps/)
- Interactive dashboards and data visualizations
- Progressive web apps with modern frameworks
- Creative portfolio websites
- Online tools and calculators

### üêç [Python Projects](./projects/python-tools/)
- Automation scripts and utilities
- Data analysis and machine learning projects
- CLI tools and productivity applications
- Web scrapers and API integrations

### üéÆ [Interactive Projects](./projects/games/)
- Browser-based games (puzzles, arcade-style, strategy)
- Educational simulations and demos
- Creative coding and generative art
- Interactive storytelling applications

### üìö [Learning & Documentation](./projects/learning/)
- Programming tutorials with live examples
- Code snippet collections and templates
- Best practices guides
- Technical documentation with interactive elements

### üõ†Ô∏è [Developer Tools](./projects/developer-tools/)
- Code generators and templates
- Development environment setups
- Testing utilities and frameworks
- Deployment automation scripts

## Getting Started

1. **Choose a project type** from the ideas above or suggest your own
2. **Define the scope** - let's start small and iterate
3. **Pick technologies** - we can work with various languages and frameworks
4. **Collaborate** - you provide requirements and feedback, I'll help with implementation

## üîí Security Guidelines

**Important: Never commit secrets or credentials to this repository!**

### Environment Variables (Required for Deployment)

When deploying to Vercel, you must set the following environment variables in your Vercel dashboard:

#### Required API Keys:
- `GEMINI_API_KEY` - Your Google Gemini API key
- `FIREBASE_API_KEY` - Firebase project API key
- `FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN` - Firebase auth domain
- `FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID` - Firebase project ID
- `FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET` - Firebase storage bucket
- `FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID` - Firebase messaging sender ID
- `FIREBASE_APP_ID` - Firebase app ID
- `FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID` - Firebase measurement ID

#### Required Admin Configuration:
- `ADMIN_TOKEN` - Secure admin authentication token
- `ADMIN_EMAIL` - Admin email address for elevated privileges

### üìñ Complete Setup Guide

For detailed step-by-step instructions on obtaining all API keys and tokens, see:
**[üîê KEYS_AND_TOKENS_GUIDE.md](./KEYS_AND_TOKENS_GUIDE.md)**

### Quick Setup Summary:

1. **Firebase Console**: Get 7 configuration values from your Firebase project settings
2. **Google AI Studio**: Generate your Gemini API key
3. **Generate Admin Token**: Create a secure 32+ character token
4. **Vercel Dashboard**: Add all 10 environment variables in project settings

### Local Development:

Create a `.env.local` file in your project root (this file is automatically ignored by git):

```bash
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_firebase_api_key_here
# ... add other variables as needed
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Never commit `.env` files or hardcode secrets in your source code!**
