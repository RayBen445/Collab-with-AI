## Getting Started

1. **Choose a project type** from the ideas above or suggest your own
2. **Define the scope** - let's start small and iterate
3. **Pick technologies** - we can work with various languages and frameworks
4. **Collaborate** - you provide requirements and feedback, I'll help with implementation

## Project Structure

## How to Collaborate

1. **Start a conversation** - describe what you'd like to build
2. **Iterate together** - I'll implement while you provide feedback
3. **Test and refine** - we'll make sure everything works perfectly
4. **Document our work** - so others can learn from our collaboration

## Technologies We Can Use
